### Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an aerospace engineer who took a turn into software engineering. I live in Boulder, Colorado and currently work at Ball Aerospace.

## Work

* **Ball Aerospace**: supporting the Systems Operability group within mission controls and operations engineering, mainly working on an internal software extension of the popular open source COSMOS ground system software. Did some work with dockerization and bash scripting looking to automate menial tasks and improve efficiency. Learning everyday, interested right now in our team's transition to a CI/CD workflow with Kubernetes deployed on our local cloud server! 

* **Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research**: made some neat data visualizations working with atmospheric concentrations from the Boulder Reservoir, some for news articles lamenting the state on oil/gas emissions, and some for publications. Did a basic website design to display real time data for the Summit, Greenland monitoring site, and helped to improve the backend automated data processor behind it. 

* **University of Colorado Boulder**: mostly MATLAB experience, as reflected in some of the repositories on my page. Lots of data handling, reading poor data and shaping it into something useable, applying equations / algos learned in class. Did a fair bit of work throughout the four years with nonlinear equation solvers, and some higher level statistical analysis of state space models with Kalman filters for a graduate class. Handled some automated electronics testing using RS232 communication with a power supply for detector testing on the CIRBE CubeSat mission over at LASP.
